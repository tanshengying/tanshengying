- 👋 Hi, My name is Tan Sheng Ying or you can call me Adrian.
- 🌱 I’m currently an undergraduate in Murdoch University studying comp science and cybersecurity as my major. 
- 💞️ I’m using this as a platform to jot down my coding journey. I will be posting my codes that I have done for my school assessment and other projects that I will be doing in the future. 
- 📫 Please feel free to give me any feedbacks in my code so that I can better improve my coding skills. Thank you so much in advance. 


Additional Info:
I do considered myself as someone that is still very new to coding, please do give me any feedbacks on the assignment and projects that I will be sharing through this platform. Thanks so much in advance.
